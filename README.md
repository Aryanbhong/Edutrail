# Edutrail


EduTrail is a full-stack e-learning platform that connects students and instructors in one place. Users can sign up as either a student or an instructor.

Students can browse available courses, enroll through secure Razorpay payments, and track their learning progress.
Instructors can create and manage courses, making their content accessible to learners.

The platform includes JWT-based authentication, role-based access control, and a user-friendly dashboard for both roles. EduTrail is designed to make online learning simple, secure, and scalable.
